    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I’ve used this mayonnaise recipe more times than I can count.
        If you’ve never tried homemade mayonnaise, you are in for a treat.
        Homemade mayo is ultra creamy and much more flavorful than anything
        you can buy at the store. This recipe calls for a simple list of
        ingredients and takes less than 10 minutes to make!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh ice fish </li>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Green Bell pepper</li>
        <li>Red Bell pepper 🌶️</li>
        <li>Yellow bell pepper</li>
        <ol>Vegetable oil</ol>
        <ol>Salt to taste</ol>
        <ol>Curry, ginger . Garlic</ol>
        <ol>Seasoning cubes </ol>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ul>
        <ol><strong>Prepare Your food processor.</strong> I prefer to use the small bowl attachment that came with our food processor to make mayonnaise.</ol>
        <ol><strong>Add an egg</strong> to the bowl of your food processor and process for about 20 seconds.</ol>
        <ol><strong>Add mustard, vinegar, and salt</strong> then process for another 20 seconds.</ol>
        <ol><strong>Slowly add the oil</strong>, in tiny drops, until about a quarter of the oil has been added.
            Adding the oil slowly is really important. If you were to dump it all in at once, you’d have mayonnaise soup!</ol>
        <ol><strong>Taste the mayonnaise</strong> and adjust with additional salt and vinegar or lemon juice.</ol>    
    </ul>
